Project Objectives
This project aims to analyze the evolution of depression frequency in the United States between 2012 and 2018, focusing on several key areas:

Temporal Evolution: To determine how the frequency of depression has changed over time.
Gender Differences: To analyze whether there are significant differences in depression frequency between men and women.
Age Relationship: To establish the relationship between age and depression frequency.
Project Development
The project was executed using Power BI to visualize and analyze data from a dataset containing information on depression frequency within the U.S. population. The following steps were undertaken:

Data Collection
Data were gathered that include variables such as year, gender, age, education level, income, and depression frequency.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning tasks were performed, including normalizing categories and handling missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Analysis
Visualization: Power BI was utilized to create visualizations that illustrate trends over the years.
Gender and Age Analysis: Graphs and tables were employed to analyze differences between genders and variations in depression frequency by age.
Result Interpretation
Results extracted from the visualizations were analyzed to answer the initial research questions.

Conclusions
Evolution of Depression Frequency: The analysis revealed variations in depression frequency from 2012 to 2018, with notable peaks occurring in specific age and gender groups during certain years.

Gender Differences: Women exhibited a higher frequency of depression compared to men across various categories, particularly in younger age groups (18 to 34) and older adults (65+ years).

Age Relationship: It was found that as age increases, the frequency of depression tends to rise. Data suggest that the 55 to 64 and 65+ age groups have significantly higher rates of depression compared to younger groups.

This analysis has provided a comprehensive insight into the state of depression in the studied population, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions aimed at vulnerable groups, especially older women and middle-aged individuals.
